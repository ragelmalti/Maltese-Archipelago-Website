## Origin in Abjads


Interestingly, Maltese scripting has gone through various phases and used to include these letters:
Чɥ
Identical to Ċ, is a cyrillic letter used by slavic languages

Ɯɯ
Identical to X, looks similar to cyrillic Ш, but also Arabic ش or moreso س, which leads us to another interesting observation

Here are all Maltese consonants with their respective Arabic counterpart (vowels use variations of Alef):
Bb	ب
Ċċ	چ (Not standard)
Dd	د
Ff	ف
Ġġ	ج
Gg	ج (Egyptian Arabic)
GĦ	غ
Hh	ه
Ħħ	ح
Jj	ي
Kk	ﻙ
Ll	ل
Mm	م
Nn	ن
Pp	پ (Not standard)
Qq	ع
Rr	ر
Ss	س
Tt	ت
Vv	ڤ (Not standard)
Ww	و
Xx	ش
Żż	ز	
Zz	ﻙ (Najdi Arabic)

This makes Maltese one of the easiest European languages to write using Arabic script, despite the Italian influence which forces for non standard Arabic characters to be used

# GRAMMAR

## Definite article

Xemxin (sun consonants): ċ d n r s t x ż z
Qamrin (moon consonants): b f ġ g għ h ħ j k l m p q v w

With sun letters, the definite article is formed by adding the first letter of the noun onto the letter "I". So words starting with N have the article "In-" attached to the word as a prefix, those with S have "Is-", those with Ċ "Iċ-" and so forth

Moon letters always use "Il-" as the definite article, attached to the word as a prefix, how simple

Words starting with two consonants have the article "L-i" attached to the word as a prefix

When an article starts with "I", this "I" may be dropped if the previous word finished in a vowel, for a smoother sound

## Gender

Maltese has two genders; Male and Female. Gender is important as only adjectives of the same gender of the noun can be paired together (generally).

It is important to know the gender of a noun so you know what type of adjective to pair it with. With italian derived nouns, it is usually feminine if the noun ends in an "a"

Many Maltese adjectives (especially ones of italian origin) make their feminine form by adding an "a" on the end of the masculine form.

## Plural

Plurals denote several of a noun (Cars, rather than car. Men rather than man). Plural nouns also require the adjective to be in plural form aswell, in addition to being in the same gender. For Italian nouns and adjectives, an "i" is added onto the end of the word, or if the final letter of the word is already a vowel, that final vowel is replaced with the "i"

## Adverbs

They come after the verb

## Comparatives

Some words will have their own comparative form that will need to be learned, however for words without there are still options.

Using the word "more" after the adjective forms the comparative for adjectived deprived of a comparative

Iktar	More
Aktar	More

To compare to a specific person or noun, you can use a "minn" to compare

Minn	Than; From
Minni	Than me; From me
Minnek	Than you; From you
Minnu	Than him; From him
Minnha	Than her; From her
Minna	Than us; From us
Minnkom	Than you [plural]; From you [plural]
Minnhom	Than them; From them

## Prepositions
The preposition is followed by the definite article.
Prepositions are also joined to sun letters.

fi	in
bi	with
ma'	with
ta'	of
sa	as far as
minn	from
għal	for 
lil	to
bħal	like

## Superlatives

Adding "L-aktar" before the adjective forms this.

## Possessive pronouns

Ta'	Of
Tiegħi	My
Tiegħek	Your
Tiegħu His
Tagħha	Her [possessive]
Tagħna	Our

## Conjugation

### Root
Maltese has uses Semitic roots to derive meanings for words.
Roots are based on 3 consonants (called radicals), but infrequently, 4 or 5. 
Let's look at some examples:

The root √K-T-B, is used for words related to writing.
KTieB - A noun meaning book
KiTTieB - A noun meaning writer
KiTeB - A verb meaning to write.

Semitic are not just prevelant in Maltese, but also other Semitic languages like Hebrew or Arabic. Words in these languages, with the K-T-B root, will also give you words relating to writing.

### Negative
To turn a verb into it's negative, you add the letter 'm' to the beginning of the verb.
Then, you put the letter 'x' at the end of the verb.

For Example:
m'iniex - I am not
mhux - He is not

### Perfect (past)
Italian
Add the following onto the mamma for the following conjugations:
-?jt	I [past tense verb]
-?jt	You [past tense verb]
-?	He [past tense verb]
-?t	She [past tense verb]
-?jna	We [past tense verb]
-?jtu	You [plural] [past tense verb]
-?w	They [past tense verb]



### Imperfect (present)
Made by two conjugations (singular and plural) and a suffix to denote the subject (person or thing doing the verb). 
Plural forms are often formed by doing the following to singular:
- Adding a "w" or "u"
- Swapping letters and then adding a "w" or "u"
- Replacing final vowel with "w" or "u"
(Note: "w" used after vowel, "u" after consonant)

Arabic
If singular form ends in consonant with a vowel before it, swap last two letters around and make last letter "u".
If singular form ends in 2 consonants, simply add a "u" to make plural form
If singular form ends in vowel, add an "w" to the end if the last letter is an "e" or "a" or replace the last letter with an "u" if the last letter is an "i"



Italian
Singular form is the mamma form (pseudo-infinitive, the dictionary form 3rd person male perfect, whichever you prefer)
Plural form is the mamma with a "w" on the end, and the subject suffixes are as follows:
n-	I [verb]; We [verb]
t-	You [verb]; She [verb]
j-	He [verb]; They [verb]

### Imperative (commands)

Italian
Singular imperative is the singular imperfect with no subject suffixes
Plural imperative is the plural imperfect with no subject suffixes
