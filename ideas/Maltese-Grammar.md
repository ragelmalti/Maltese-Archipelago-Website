## Closer look at Maltese script


Interestingly, Maltese scripting has gone through various phases and used to include these letters:
Чɥ
Identical to Ċ, is a cyrillic letter used by slavic languages

Ɯɯ
Identical to X, looks similar to cyrillic Ш, but also Arabic ش or moreso س, which leads us to another interesting observation

Here are all Maltese consonants with their respective Arabic counterpart (vowels use variations of Alef):
- Bb	ب
- Ċċ	چ (Not standard)
- Dd	د
- Ff	ف
- Gg	ج (Egyptian Arabic)
- Ġġ	ج
- GĦ	غ
- Ħħ	ح
- Hh	ه
- Jj	ي
- Kk	ﻙ
- Ll	ل
- Nn	ن
- Mm	م
- Pp	پ (Not standard)
- Rr	ر
- Qq	ع
- Ss	س
- Tt	ت
- Vv	ڤ (Not standard)
- Xx	ش
- Ww	و
- Zz	ﻙ (Najdi Arabic)
- Żż	ز

This makes Maltese one of the easiest European languages to write using Arabic script, despite the Italian influence which forces for non standard Arabic characters to be used

# GRAMMAR

## Definite article

Xemxin (sun consonants): ċ d n r s t x ż z
Qamrin (moon consonants): b f ġ g għ h ħ j k l m p q v w

With sun letters, the definite article is formed by adding the first letter of the noun onto the letter "I". So words starting with N have the article "In-" attached to the word as a prefix, those with S have "Is-", those with Ċ "Iċ-" and so forth

Moon letters always use "Il-" as the definite article, attached to the word as a prefix, how simple

Words starting with two consonants have the article "L-i" attached to the word as a prefix

When an article starts with "I", this "I" may be dropped if the previous word finished in a vowel, for a smoother sound

## Gender

Maltese has two genders; Male and Female. Gender is important as only adjectives of the same gender of the noun can be paired together (generally).

It is important to know the gender of a noun so you know what type of adjective to pair it with. With italian derived nouns, it is usually feminine if the noun ends in an "a"

Many Maltese adjectives (especially ones of italian origin) make their feminine form by adding an "a" on the end of the masculine form.

## Plural

Plurals denote several of a noun (Cars, rather than car. Men rather than man). Plural nouns also require the adjective to be in plural form aswell, in addition to being in the same gender. For Italian nouns and adjectives, an "i" is added onto the end of the word, or if the final letter of the word is already a vowel, that final vowel is replaced with the "i"

## Adverbs

They come after the verb

## Comparatives

Some words will have their own comparative form that will need to be learned, however for words without there are still options.

Using the word "more" after the adjective forms the comparative for adjectived deprived of a comparative

Iktar	More
Aktar	More

To compare to a specific person or noun, you can use a "minn" to compare

Minn	Than; From
Minni	Than me; From me
Minnek	Than you; From you
Minnu	Than him; From him
Minnha	Than her; From her
Minna	Than us; From us
Minnkom	Than you [plural]; From you [plural]
Minnhom	Than them; From them

## Prepositions
The preposition is followed by the definite article.
Prepositions are also joined to sun letters.

fi	in
bi	with
ma'	with
ta'	of
sa	as far as
minn	from
għal	for
lil	to
bħal	like

## Superlatives

Adding "L-aktar" before the adjective forms this.

## Possessive pronouns

Ta'	Of
Tiegħi	My
Tiegħek	Your
Tiegħu His
Tagħha	Her [possessive]
Tagħna	Our
Tagħkom	Your [plural]
Tagħhom	Their

jien / jiena	I
int / inti	You
hu / huwa	He & it
hi / hija 	She & it
aħna		We

## Conjugation

### Root
Maltese has uses Semitic roots to derive meanings for words.
Roots are based on 3 consonants (called radicals), but infrequently, 4 or 5.
Let's look at some examples:

The root √K-T-B, is used for words related to writing.
KTieB - A noun meaning book
KiTTieB - A noun meaning writer
KiTeB - A verb meaning to write.

Semitic are not just prevelant in Maltese, but also other Semitic languages like Hebrew or Arabic. Words in these languages, with the K-T-B root, will also give you words relating to writing.

###Conjugation forms

When conjugating in Maltese, a verb can be conjugated in four ways that will be known as the

### Imperfect (present tense)

Singular Imperative (SI)
Conjugation for present tense when only ony one person or entity performs a verb (Conjugation for imperfect singular)

Plural Imperative (PI)
Conjugation for present tense when several people or entities performs a verb (Conjugation for imperfect plural)

Papa (this is a nickname I'll denote for this conjugation)
Conjugation for past tense when the speaker or listener (1st person and 2nd person) performs a verb (Conjugation for perfect 1st and 2nd person)

Mamma
Conjugation for past tense when someone other than speaker or listener (1st person and 2nd person) performs a verb (Conjugation for perfect 3rd person)

the imperfect tense refers to verbs that are done in the present. It is formed by getting CIS for when one subject acts out the verb and CIP when several subjects act it out, and adding the appropriate suffixes to denote WHO did the verb.
The prefixes added for the imperfect are as follows:
- N-	I [with SI]; We [with PI]
- T-	You; She [with SI]
- J-	He [with SI]; They [with PI]

There are vague rules that can be used to form PI based on the SI:
- If SI ends in a vowel and then a consonant, swap the last two letters around and make last letter "u" to make root 2.
- If SI ends in 2 consonants in a row, [SI] + "u" = [PI]
- If SI ends in "a" or "e", then [SI] + "w" = [PI]
- If SI ends in "i", then [SI] - "i" + "u" = [PI]

### Perfect (past tense)

the perfect tense refers to verbs that have already been done in the past, the past tense. Imperfect uses suffixes to denote who performed the verb, while the perfect uses suffixes instead, as well as requiring the mamma and Papa conjugations
[Papa] + "t" =											I [perfect verb]; You [perfect verb]
[Mamma] =														He [perfect verb]
[Mamma] - [last consonant] + "et" =	She [perfect verb]
[Papa] + "na" =											We [perfect verb]
[Papa] + "tu" =											You [plural; perfect verb]
[Mamma] - [last consonant] + "u" =	They [perfect verb]

Some verbs that end in an "a" or "e" (Italian verbs included here), as well as some shorter verbs follow a slightly different pattern, as demonstrated below:
[Papa] + "jt" =		I [perfect verb]; You [perfect verb]
[Mamma] =					He [perfect verb]
[Mamma] + "t" =		She [perfect verb]
NOTE: Often the 3rd person female changes irregularly, this will need to be learnt by heart

[Papa] + "jna" =	We [perfect verb]
[Papa] + "jtu" =	You [plural; perfect verb]
[Mamma] + "w" =		They [perfect verb]
NOTE: Sometimes "għu" is used instead of "w" (usually for verbs with GĦ as their final root)

### Imperative mood

The imperative denotes that a verb is a command, an instruction to do a verb, and can be directed to a singular or several entities.
This is by far the easiest mood, as the singular form is simply the SI and the plural is the PI.

### Negative

To turn a verb into it's negative, The auxiliary verb "ma" is added before the verb. If the verb starts with a vowel, this is shortened to "m'" and is attached directly to the verb. Then the letter "x" is added onto the end of the verb.

For Example:
m'iniex - I am not
mhux - He is not
