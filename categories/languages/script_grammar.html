		<h1> Early descriptions of the Maltese Archipeligo</h1>
		</header>
		<div>
		<p> This article will provide three early descriptions from antiquity, that I know of, regarding the Maltese Archipeligo. They come from Diodorous Siculus, Gnaeus Naevius, and Livy.
		<p> Diodorous Siculus, was an Ancient Greek Historian. In his book, 'The Library of History,' written in the 1 century BC, he recounts many ancient events and countries. One of them is the Maltese Archipeligo, as stated in Book 5 Chapter 12: </p>
		<blockquote cite="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5A*.html#12"> For off the south of Sicily three islands <span class="comment">(The two that are mentioned in the extract, Melitê and Gaulus, are now apart of Malta as a nation)</span> lie out in the sea, and each of them possesses a city and harbours which can offer safety to ships which are in stress of weather. The first one is that called Melitê <span class="comment">(Malta)</span>,which lies about eight hundred stades from Syracuse, and it possesses many harbours which offer exceptional advantages, and its inhabitants are blest in their possessions; for it has artisans skilled in every manner of craft, the most important being those who weave linen, which is remarkably sheer and soft, and the dwellings on the island are worthy of note, being ambitiously constructed with cornices and finished in stucco with unusual workmanship. This island is a colony planted by the Phoenicians, who, as they extended their trade to the western ocean, found in it a place of safe retreat, since it was well supplied with harbours and lay out in the open sea; and this is the reason why the inhabitants of this island, since they received assistance in many respects through the sea-merchants, shot up quickly in their manner of living and increased in renown. </blockquote>
		<blockquote cite="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/5A*.html#12"> After this island there is a second which bears the name of Gaulus <span class="comment">(Gozo)</span>, lying out in the open sea and adorned with well-situated harbours, a Phoenician colony.</blockquote>
		<p> As Siculus states, in those days, Malta was a Phoenician colony. The Phoenicians were a group of wandering traders, orginating in modern day Lebanon, who travelled all throughout the Mediterranean.
