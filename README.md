This is the github repository for the Maltese Archipeligo Information Website.

A spiritual successor to the now defunct aboutmalta.com, this website was made to showcase information on the Maltese Archipeligo, including it's History, Language and Culture, in a singular place. 

On this website, you will find original articles, external web links and resources, pertaining to Malta.

The public is free to contribute to this website, by submitting code to this github repo, or, by emaling me at: [malti-archipelago-info@protonmail.com](malti-archipelago-info@protonmail.com)
