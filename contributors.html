			<li><b>Michel via direct message</b> - The first external contributor to the website. Provided me with links to language teachers / language schools, that taught the Maltese language. Also provided links about applying for Maltese citizenship. In his words: <i>"Also worth looking up and adding links to Maltese citizenship as most first generation Maltese born overseas are considered citizens, they just need to claim their birth rights"</i></li>
