		<h1> About us </h1>
		</header>
		<div>
		<p> This website was created and inspired by conversations I had with a friend. </p>
		<p> We would often talk to each other about Malta, and every piece of information we knew about it, the Maltese language, the island's history, and its culture. </p>
		<p> Both of us were 3rd generation descendants of Maltese migrants, living in Australia. Because of this, my friend and I, didn't really know a whole lot about Malta. </p>
		<p> On top of this, I found it frustrating to find information on Malta. A lot of it was: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Scattered across the internet. </li>
			<li> In books that were hard to find within Australia.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Frustrated by the lack of a centralised source of information, I had an idea to create a website that combined original articles and web resources about Malta. </p>
		<p> Taking inspiration from Grazio Falzon's aboutmalta.com, on the 1st of May 2021, I bit the bullet, and created the <i> Maltese Archipelago Information</i> website.</p>
		<p> I distributed the website source code on <a href="https://github.com/ragelmalti/Maltese-Archipelago-Website">github</a>, so my friend and I, and members of the public, can contribute to the website.</p>
		<p> I also made the website under the Creative Commons 0 licence. This means that all original articles are in the public domain, and the information written, can be freely used by members of the public. </p>
		<p> I hope that this website proves useful to all who are interested in the island nation of Malta. </p>
		<p><i>Grazzi u alla jbierek! :)</i></p>
